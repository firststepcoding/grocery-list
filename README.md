# Grocery List Generator

Thanks to this wonderful application, never again will you have to struggle with manually writing out your grocery list!

To run it: `ruby grocery-list.rb`

- The program will prompt you for items you'd like added to your grocery list and their respective quantities.

- Once you have indicated you are done, by typing `done`, the program will generate a neatly formatted file called `groceries.txt` with a line for each of your groceries.

Here is an example `groceries.txt` file it can generate.

```
lemons - 2
garlic cloves - 3
whole chickens - 1
onions - 1
```
